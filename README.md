# PAD2020_GenomicSequence_to_Species_Cluster

This project is my very first GitHub upload :-D the project useses a dynamic programming approach to get the job done. will ultimatly have 4 functions acording to the following discription:


In this project you will implement a program that reads genomics sequences from a file and clusters them in a tree according to their pairwise evolutionary distances. 
No prior knowledge on genomics is necessary. 
The project has four main parts (P1â€”P4). 
P1 and P3 are relatively straightforward. 
P4 is a little bit more difficult. 
P2 is challenging. 
Each part should be encapsulated in a module, with respective names
P1.py, P2.py, P3.py, P4.py
